1. Create views
    - views needs from django.http import Httpresponse
2. Create URL paths
    - create the urls.py file within the APP directory
    - every path() needs 3 things
        - the url path e.g. ''
        - the view which is pulled for that path e.g. views.index or views.game
        - the name e.g. name = "index"
        
3. Link app URL paths to main URL paths
