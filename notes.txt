1. Create views
    - views needs from django.http import Httpresponse
    - all views are functions that take a response and then return another respone
2. Create URL paths
    - create the urls.py file within the APP directory
    - The path() function is passed four arguments, two required: route and view, and two optional: 
      kwargs, and name. At this point, itâ€™s worth reviewing what these arguments are for.

3. Link app URL paths to main URL paths

4. Create Models
    - Change your models (in models.py).
    - Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
    - Link the app in Settings.py
    - Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.

5. Django ORM
    - Question.objects.all() pulls all objects
    - q = Question(question_text = "asdfasdf", pub_date = timezone.now())
    - q.save()
    - q.id, q.question_text, etc.
